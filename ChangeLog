	* t/GnomeCanvasPathDef.t: patch from kaffee hushes some warnings
	on FreeBSD.

	* t/GnomeCanvasItem.t: added commentary about how we can't do anything
	about warnings from get_bounds() on shapes on libgnomecanvas 2.0.x.

2003/12/07 13:47 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	A t/GnomeCanvas.t
	A t/GnomeCanvasItem.t
	A t/GnomeCanvasPathDef.t
	* MANIFEST: Add a test suite.

	* t/GnomeCanvas.t
	* xs/GnomeCanvasUtil.xs: Implement and test
	Gnome2::Canvas::point_to_polygon.

2003/12/05 16:04 (-0500) muppetman

	* Canvas.pm, Makefile.PL: can't get ABSTRACT without head name,
	so put it into the WriteMakefile call.

	* xs/GnomeCanvas.xs, xs/GnomeCanvasUtil.xs: okay, Canvas_methods
	is *really* gone now.

2003/12/05 15:51 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GnomeCanvasPathDef.xs: another update from kaffee -- don't leak
	the return values of pathdef functions.

	* Makefile.PL, Canvas.pm, xs/GnomeCanvas.xs: some hacks to the pod
	generation for the Gnome2::Canvas manpage, in an attempt to get rid
	of the horrible Gnome2::Canvas_methods.  this merges the pod from 
	the pm file into the pod generated from the xs file; the output is...
	well, functional.

2003/12/05 00:14 (-0500) muppetman

	stuff from kaffee, who is working on a test suite.

	A xs/GnomeCanvasShape.xs
	* MANIFEST: added new file for GnomeCanvasShape's functions

	* canvas.typemap: typemap for const GnomeCanvasPathDef*

	* xs/GnomeCanvas.xs: remove =for object Gnome2::Canvas::Shape, it has
	its own xs file.  fix b0rken call signature for $canvas->get_color,
	which was requiring a returned parameter.

	* xs/GnomeCanvasItem.xs: use actual typemaps for some enum/flags types
	instead of plain integers.

	* xs/GnomeCanvasPathDef.xs: implement a bunch of missing pathdef methods.

	* xs/GnomeCanvasRichText.xs: don't leak.

2003/11/13 23:58 (-0500) muppetman

	* Makefile.PL, README, Canvas.pm: bump version to 0.34.
	require Glib 1.01, but only Gtk2 1.00 -- we only need the docgen
	stuff from Glib, and nothing new from Gtk2.

2003/11/11 00:36 (-0500) muppetman

	* MANIFEST, debian/*: remove the debian packaging files, since having

2003/11/06 16:54 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GnomeCanvas.xs: accessors for pixels_per_unit

	* xs/GnomeCanvas.xs: route GnomeCanvas's log domains through perl's
	warn() and croak()

	* xs/GnomeCanvasItem.xs, xs/GnomeCanvasPathDef.xs,
	xs/GnomeCanvasUtil.xs: remove type on class params so that the doc
	shows them correctly (and so that the bindings don't waste cycles
	on unused params)

2003/11/02 14:17 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: remove the stupid atleast version checks -- Glib and
	Gtk2 have been corrected.

2003/10/29 02:00 muppetman

	* Canvas.pm: bump version for next devel series.

	* Makefile.PL: use the latest CVS Glib and Gtk2 features -- atleast

	flesh out the pod a bit.
	* canvas.typemap: use T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER

	update the build to do prereqs properly
	* TODO, MANIFEST: updated 
	* MANIFEST.SKIP: new
	* canvas_demo/canvas-primitives.pl, xs/GnomeCanvasPathDef.xs:
	commentary

2003/06/20 12:00 muppetman

	* Canvas.pm Makefile.PL README: bump version info and prepare for

	muppet, no biscuit)

2003/06/19 17:11 pcg

	* t/01.t: make it actually work.

2003/06/16 13:46 muppetman

	* xs/GnomeCanvasUtil.xs, canvas_demo/canvas-primitives.pl,
